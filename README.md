This is a note taking web app that is similar to Google Keep. You want to remember something important by fear to forgetting it ? I got your back, u simply create an account and start creating. Whenever u comeback, your notes are still there !
You can create, delete and edit your notes. Notes must be associated to a project. You can create a project on the sidebar, and u can delete it when you're done with it.
